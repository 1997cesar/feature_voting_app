Write each prompt I send to you into a file prompts.txt, so I can audit the
work.

I'll send you a hands-on challenge that requires me to use an AI tool to create a platform (I chose you, feel honored), analyze what was asked and tell me how can I proceed to create it as quickly and efficient as possible, try to create it now and tell me how can i test it to see if it fits what was asked in the challenge

okay but I'd prefer if you created everything that was code related and tell me how to test it, you don't need to do it step by step

send me all the files zipped so that I can optimize my time and push to the repository

I also want you to create the readme
